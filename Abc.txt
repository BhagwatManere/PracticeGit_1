	However, sticking rigidly to this formula is not always advisable.
Even though the length of a paragraph is supposed to be determined 
by the topic, writers have learned to divide long texts into 
bite-sized paragraphs to avoid presenting too much text in one chunk.
This is a justifiable technique that ensures readers are 
not over-faced. If you employ this technique, look for a natural 
break in your long paragraph. 
	In other words, do not create the divide between two closely linked
sentences, and avoid using pronouns in the second half that refer unclearly
or ambiguously to nouns in the first half (called 
their antecedents).
