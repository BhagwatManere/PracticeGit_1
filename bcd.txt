	paragraph could be part of a text that informs people, 
describes something, critiques something, compares things, 
persuades people, lists a process, makes an argument, offers a 
solution, or narrates a story. The level of detail will vary from 
text to text, so there is no answer to the question "how long is a 
paragraph?".

	This diversity means that it's not always easy 
to determine what "one topic" means when dividing your text 
into paragraphs. For example, you could have a one-topic 
paragraph describing Venus (with the next paragraph describing Mars)
or a one-topic paragraph describing the hues of a sunset 
(with the next paragraph describing its reflection in the sea).
